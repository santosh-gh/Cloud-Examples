## Building and deploying to an AKS cluster using Terraform and Azure DevOps with Kubernetes and Helm providers

I have a few blogs now on deploying Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) with different scenarios, such as deploying AKS with Application Gateway Ingress, in this blog post I am going to be building and deploying to an AKS cluster using Terraform and Azure DevOps. You will also have noticed in the title, it references both Kubernetes and Helm providers - we will be looking at how Terraform can be used to deploy to AKS as well once deployed. I am huge fan of GitOps within AKS, but to test an application or small environment; this way could certainly be useful!
