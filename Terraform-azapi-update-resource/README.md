## Using the Terraform resource azapi_update_resource to update Azure resources that are not yet supported in AzureRMÂ provider

A few months ago, there was an announcement of AzAPI terraform provider, that enables you to manage any Azure resource type using any API version. You may be wondering, why the need for this? Some times with new resource updates or additions, the terraform AzureRM provider is not up to date or missing a piece of functionality within a particular resource. With this new provider, you can begin deploying using Terraform from day 1 without the need to wait until AzureRM has been updated - awesome!
